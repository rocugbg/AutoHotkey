AutoHotkey
==========

My personal AutoHotkey scripts.  
  

Includes some shortcuts  
-----------------------
* to web pages
* to mute/unmute the master volume
* to open the calculator
* to open notepad
* to minimize active window (like on Mac OS MAC+H)


Download AutoHotkey [here](http://www.autohotkey.com).  
  

After installing AutoHotKey just doubleclick on the .ahk-file to start it. If you change the script file don't forget to reload the script from the menu.
